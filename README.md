# Drone-Mapping
This project is made to measure the distance of two points from a picture of a drone.
 The resolution of the picture is currently set to 4000 X 3000 pixels.
 The angle at which the picture is taken is 94 Degrees. 
 The user will need to enter the height of the drone, and the x and y coordinates (pixels) of the two points.
