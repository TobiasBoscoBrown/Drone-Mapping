# Drone-Mapping
This project is made to measure the distance of two points from a picture of a drone.
 The resolution of the picture is currently set to 4000 X 3000 pixels.
 The angle at which the picture is taken is 94 Degrees. 
 The user will need to enter the height of the drone, and the x and y coordinates (pixels) of the two points.
 
 This project also has the option of calculating the how long it will take for sound to travel through objects.
 The user will need to enter the choice between air, water, and steel.
 The user will need to enter the distance in feet that sound will have to travel through.
